# Project Web

1. Simple Calculator<br>
   This is my first project web. This calculator is very simple and has several operators such as add, subtract, divide, multiply, modulus, root, exponent, trigonometric    functions (sin, cos, tan). I made this project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
